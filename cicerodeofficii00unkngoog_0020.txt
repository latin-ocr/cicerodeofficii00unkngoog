xvi Introduction

the Stoic, one of the most accomplished men of the day, lived
for many yearS, from B.c. 88 until his death, as an inmate of his
house3 and he spent his time in close study with him. Cra-
tippus, the head of the Peripatetic School at AthenS, under
whose tuition he placed his son, was pronounced by him to be
the greatest of those whom he had heard, and not inferior in
merit to the most eminent of his school. We should expect
a priori that such diversified experience of theories and teachers
would operate together with the natural tendencies of the age as
a predisposing influence to a greater or less degree of scepti-
cism—especially in a man of Cicero's peculiar weakness and
indecision of character—and to an inclination for discussing
prevailing opinions rather than for independent research. To
most men indeed of his peculiar temperament the teaching of
the new Academy with its laxity of first principles and elasticity
of doctrine would be most congenial. But though Cicero ac-
knowledges himself a follower of the Academy as revived by
Carneades [ob. B.C. 129], he is far from being a Sceptic on
scientific grounds and from inward conviction of the absolute
impossibility of all knowledge. He merely rebels against dog-
matism and positivenes3‚ which he denounces as presumptuous;
and one main object of philosophy with him was to keep clear
of the arrogance of maintaining any position with a conviction
of its irrefragable truth and absolute certainty. ‘The only
prudent course was to withhold absolute assent from all doc-
trineS, while giving a qualified assent to those which seemed
most probable...He repeatedly insists that the diversities of
opinion which the most famous intellects display ought to lead
men to·teach one another with all gentleness and meekness,
In positiveness of assertion there seemed to be something reck-
less and disgraceful‚ unworthy of a sels-controlled character,—

free conflict of opinion, in fact, was necessary to the progress
of Philosophy'33.
