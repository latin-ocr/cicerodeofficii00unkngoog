(1) the demonstratio (statement of sactS‚ and ground of action),
(α) intentio (plaintiff’s claim, and the question for the decision of the
iudex, and which might be modified with the words quantum aequius
melius sit, or ex fide bona, binding the iudex to take the whole circum⁴
stances into equitable consideration), (3) condemnatio, which gave the
iudex power to condemn or aequit the defendant, and which was usually
qualified with a taxatio, restricting the amount of damages to be awarded
by the iudex to a certain maximum, or adiudicati o, giving the iudex
or arbiter power to adjudicate. We have the text of a formula given by
Gaius (4, 47), in a case where Aulus Agerius sued Numerius Negidius
sor restoration of a silver table deposited with him and, sailing restitution‚
for payment of damages :—

Octavius iudex esto; Quod Aulus Agerius apud Nume-
rium Negidium mensam argenteam deposuit,· qua de re
agitur,-

. Quidquid ob eam rem Μ Negidium A. Agerio dare facere
oportet ex fide bona eius;

iudex N. Negidium A. Agerio condemnato, ‘nisi restituat;

si non paret, absolvito.
When the parties had appeared in court, the plaintiff declared his form
of action (editio actionis), and applied to the magistrate sor a formula
(actionis postulatio). The magistrate or praetor appointed a iudex for
the trial of the case, and delivered to him a formula determining the
question to be decided. The delivery of the formula cum iudicium
accipitur was the moment of the litis contestatio, which ended the
proceedings in iure. Such formulae were those of Aquilius de dolo
malo for the guidance of the iudex in a claim of restitution, where a
fraud-had been practised in* a sale or some similar proceeding. The
formulary system remained in force until the reign of Diocletian‚
