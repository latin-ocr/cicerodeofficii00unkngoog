temperantia. But even here it will be seen that a contest with iustitia
is involved as well as with fortitudo,

Still, with all these confusionS, the chief mle is clean—if a thing
seems ‘expedient ' test it by seeing whether it is contrary to ‘wisdom '
(true not false), ‘ justice‚' ‘ fortitude,’ or ‘temperance‚’ or all combined,
the four virtues which make up honestas: if it is contrary to them, it is
not expedient (utile), but only seems to be, —for nihil utile quod non =
honestum is a postulate in Ethics.

moderatione does to temperantiae: continentia being rather the r'estraint

1. 2. optumum auctorem] Any person who determines our belief,
even as a witness, is called an auctor. Thus Tacitus Germ. c. 28, in
quoting Iulius Caesar as a witness with respect to the former state of the
Gauls, calls him summus auctorum, i-e. ‘ the highest of authoritieS,’
