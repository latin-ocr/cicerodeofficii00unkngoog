Aristotele, de fm. 1v§ 7 Zeno et ab eo qui sunt. Aristippus, born at
Cyrene and founder of the Cyrenaic school of philosophy, flourished
about B.c. 370. He deviated, both in principle and in practice, very far
lrom the teaehing and example of his master Socrates. The anecdotos
told of him in Diog. Laert. do not give us the notion of one who was
the mere slave of his passions‚ but rather of one who took a pride in
extracting enjoyment irom all circumstances and in controlling prosperity
and adversity alike (Diog. Laert. 11 66 ἦν δὲ ἱκανὸς ἁρμόσατθαι καὶ τόπῳ
καὶ χρόνῳ καὶ προσώπῳ καὶ πᾶσαν περίστασιν ἁρμονίως ὑποκρίνασθαι).
lIence Horace says (Ep. 1 1, 18) to observe his precepts is mihi res, non
me rebus subiungere, and (1 17, 2 3) omnis Aristippum decuit color et
status et res. To Xenophon and Plato he was very obnoxious. Aristotle
too calls him a sophist. The Cyrenaics divided philosophy into five
parts, viz. the study os (ι) obJects oi desire and avers-ion, (2) ieelings
and affections, (3) actions, (4) causes, (5) proofs.

1. In the first alone of these divisions is the Cyrenaic view
connected with the Socratic. Aristippus, taking up the Socratic
position that happiness (i.e. the enjoyment of a well-ordered mind) is
the aim oi all men, pronounced pleasure the chief good and pain the
chief evil, the τέλος ot human lise to be momentary pleasure (μονό-
χρονος, μερικῶς present happiness therefore was to be sought, and not
εὐδαιμονία, which is the sum of a number ol happy states. In this
point the Cyrenaics were opposed to the Epicureans. All pleasures
were considered equal: so that a man should never covet more than he
possesses and never let himself be overcome by sensual enjoyment.
Even with these concessions the Cyrenaic system destroys all moral
purity, by proposing to a man as many separate τέλη as his life contains
moments.

α. Pleasure and pain are both positive, both motions of the soul

(ἐν κινήσει). EpicuruS, on the other hand, thought pleasure to be a state
of rest (ἀταραξία).
