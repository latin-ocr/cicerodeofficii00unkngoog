1. 6. quae vacent iustitia] ‘so long as they are not concerned
with Justice’z for when the idea of Justice comes in, which is the

ᾗ supreme virtue, higher considerations may make it our duty to resist

these incommoda even though it involves homini detrahere sui causa.
[This is the reading of all but one of the MSS, which Facciolati, followed
by Stuerenberg‚ explains to mean ‘quae iniuste tibi illata sint, quae non
patiaris ex merito.' But even if the words could themselves bear that
signification, the context and the following sentence haec enim cet.
require that they should have a subjective force. Orelli's reading quae
non vacent iustin‘a is liable to the same objection. Most editors read
quae vacent iniustitia explaining haec una virtus in the next clause to
refer to iniustitiae vacatio implied in quae vacent iniustitia. Beier’s
reading quae vacent iustitiae, which he explains quae locum relinquant,
capacia sint, instittae ‘which leave room for the exercise of justice,’
scarcely deserves attention. Heine, who in his first edition read quae
vacent iniustitia, in his fifth retains the MS reading, and accepts the
conjecture of Lambinus that something of the same sentiment which is
found in ἓ 25 originally stood here, viz. z—et rursus magis esse
secundum naturam hominem homini prodesse, quam omnia
commoda percipere vel externa vel corporiS‚ ettam {psius
animi, quae vacent iustitia]

5 2⁹, 1. 8. forsitan quispiam dixerit] the second objection corre-
sponding to the first nam illud quidem absurdum. With this begins the
discussion of the seeming conflict between moral good and expediency.

dixerit] coniunctivus potentialiS, ‘some one might perchance say!
Madvig Gr. ς 350 a, Roby Gr. 11 1536.

nonne-abstulerst] hypothetical conjunctive perfect (rare), Roby
Gr. 11 1532. Cf. 1 ξ 59 ut vicinum citius adiuveris.

1. 9. honum] i.e. qui quidem sit homo.

1. 10. minime-gratia] bracketed with Miiller. The sentence
seems to be an interpolation. It contradicts the real answer to the
question, which is given in 5 301. 16. The answer to the question about
Phalaris follows in 5 32.

1. u. animi—adfectio] ‘disposition,’ ‘mood,' ‘temper,’ cp. de fin.
v 5 65, 111 ἓ 65 ax hac animorum adfectione, Tusc. lv ἓ 34 virtus est
affectio animi constans conveniensque (sc. secum), διάθεσις ψυχῆς
σύμφωνος αὐτῇ as Stobaeus ecl. eth. 11 p. 104 expresses it. Cp. Plato
legg. xl 1 οὐ ’γάρ ποτε τοσοῦτον εἰς χρημάτων ὠφεληθείην ἂν κτῆσιν
ἀνελών. ὅσον εἰς ὄγκον πρὸς ἀρετὴν ψυχῆς καὶ τὸ δίκαιον ἐπιδιδοίην ἂν μὴ
