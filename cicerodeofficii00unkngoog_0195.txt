g 10¹7, 1. 19. est autem cet] Heine ed. 5 objects to this' passage
as spoiling the connexion, as quod enim ita cet. refers immediately to,
ve'deant ne quaeratur latebra periurio. In the preceding passage Cicero
was speaking of the ‘ saithless ' man (infidelis), not of an ‘ enemy!
Moreover (he argues) an oath made to an enemy, which hostis here
means as is shewn by ius bellicum, is binding at all times and not merely
saepe· Heine also objects to fides—cum hoste as bad Latin. But the
quotations below shew that servare fidem cum is correct. Nor is there
anything in his objection that an oath to an enemy is binding at all
times and not merely saepe. For in that case the limitation ita, ut mens
σοντι-φανεῖ would be pointless. quod enim etc. does not refer to videant
ne, but est autem introduces a separate excursus on keeping saith with
an enemy, extending to ὃ 109. .

1. 20. quod emm cet„ ‘ viz. an oath which has been sworn in such
a manner that in the mind [os the swearer os that oath] there was an
idea present 'that it ought to be performed, must be kept. But in the
case osan oath, in which it is otherwise (i.e. in which you did not think
at the time you swore it that it ought to be performed), it is not perjury
to break it! Grotius misunderstood this passage from supposing that
Cicero was· speaking of the intention of the person who administers the·

oath‚ de iure b. ac p. 11 xiii 2 (Vol. 11 p. 86 ed. Whewell).
