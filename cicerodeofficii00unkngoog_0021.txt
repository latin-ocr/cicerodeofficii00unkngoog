Introduction xvii

 

The doctrines of the Porch, with its austere moral theory and
its indifference to external circumstances and material good5,
would never have become known to the Roman aristocracy if
Stoicism had required or rather admitted of consistency in
carrying out its principles, or if genuine old Stoicism had been
presented to them in all its uncouthness. Rome was not the
place for such a professor of unbending and undiluted Stoicism
as Cato; and Cicero³⁴ himself was the last sort of man to value
such inflexibility and want of adaptation to circumstances.

In one respect however its very rigour and inflexibility served
to a certain extent as a preventive of its consistency. It was
really nothing but a great inconsistency and contradiction, even
in the strictest professor of Zeno's doctrine, to wish to endeavour
to be virtuouS. The proposition that virtue is not a quality
(ἕξις) of the mind which can be improved by practice, but an
unchangeable condition (διάθεσις τῆς ψυχῆς) which does not
admit of increase or decrease, capable of being possessed only
wholly or else not at all, so that we are only then moral when
we possess it wholly, and the unwise or non-virtuous man is
absolutely viciouS, there being no mean betwixt good and evil—
such propositions as this are practically vain and useless; for
such an ideal standard of virtue is wholly beyond the power of

any man to realize, and therefore from the Stoics' own theory it
must follow that all men are unwise and viciouS.

eaque necessitate constricti, ut etiam, quae non probare soleant, ea cogantur
constantiae causa defendere ; nos, qui sequim ur prob abi lia nec ultra
quam id, quod veri simile occurrit, progredi possumus, et refellere sine
pertinacia et refelli sine iracundia parati sumus. Cf. also Acad. 11 ἓξ 7,
8, de off. 11 ἓ 8 nos autem, ut ceteri alia certa, alia incerta esse dicunt,
sic ab his dissentientes alia probabilia, contra alia clu-imus. Quid est
igitur quod me impediat ea quae probabilia mihi videantur sequi, quae
contra, improbare atque affirmandi arrogantiam vitantem sugere
temeritatem, quae a sapientia dissidet plurimum.

⁸⁴ See n. to ἓ 88 ll. 26, 27 and cf. Att. 11 i 8 Catonem nostrum non
tu amas plus quam ego, sed tamen ille optimo animo utens et summa

side nocet interdum reipublicae; dicit enim tamquam in Platonis
πολιτείᾳ, non tamquam in Romuli faece sententiam.
