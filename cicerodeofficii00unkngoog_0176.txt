tetueruatth· summum erat periculum ne, si nihil impetrassent, plane
alienarentur a senatu, ib. 18, 7 unus est qui garet constantia magas
et integritate quam, ut mihi vt‘detur, consilio aut ingemo, Cam, qui
nuk-eros publicanos, quos habuit amantissimos sui, tertium iam mensem
vexat neque eis a senatu responsum dari patitur: ila nos cogimur

1. 28. oum mis sie ageres—soleremus] ‘to deal with the former as
we usually do with, our own tenants‚' to whom we remit a portion os
their rent in bad yearS, see Plin. ep. 1x 37.

1⁸. 40, 1. 1. soleremus] ‘are wont, as I then stated in my speech?

barbarians as sar north as the Danube, and celebrated a triumph over
the Dardanians in 71 (in Pis. ἓ 44). An intimate friend and supportet
