1. 17. ιιοιι ea, quae—redhibeatur lure clvm] ⁴ I do not mean such
suum, as if not mentioned, the slave must be returned on the seller's
handS, according to the law of the land‚’ the sale being null and void.
Redlcibere is a technical legal term, Ulpian dig. xx1 1, ἓ 11 redhi-
bere est facere ut mrsus habeat venditor quod habuerit. The act of
returning an object under these circumstances was called redhibitio,
and a suit brought to compel the seller to receive the object and to
return the price was actio redhibitoria and so iudicium redhibi-

torium. See Quintl. inst. or. vnl 3, Aul. Gell. N.A. Π 2, xvn 6. -

Plautus employs the word Merc. 11 iii 84 dixit se redhibere si non
placeat, i.e. (the purchaser) ‘said that he would return her, if she did
not give satisfaction‚' Most. 111 ii 111 si male emptae forent, nobis has
redhibere haud liceret, where see Ramsay’s note.

ea, quae mal mem] ἕ 71.

1. 18. turacem] furax, ‘thievish,’ merely marks the slave's cha-
racter and therefore is not so strong a word as sur, which would imply
that the slave had been tried and found guilty os theft and therefore
could not be warranted by the seller. There· is no inconsistency be-
tween this sentence and 5 71 qui scire debuit—de fiatis, praestat edicto
aedilium. If a slave manifested a thievish disposition by stealing from
his master, it was not necessary to declare it when he was offered for
sale. But if the owner os a slave, when he offered him sor sale, con-
cealed the fact that the slave had made his master liable for damages by
stealing from a third person, he was responsible and might be required
to take the slave back. Marcian dig. xxl deaedil. edict. 1, 52 si
fur‘tum domino fecerit, non est necesse hoc in venditione servi praedicere,
nec ex hac causa redhibitio est.

‘mountain-eoppa) The word is also written aurichalcum, but in-
accurately, the first syllable being short, Hor. A. P. 202 tibia non ut
