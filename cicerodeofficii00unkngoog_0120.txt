92 NOTES Boox III c 1x ἓ 39

1. 11. ῐοοοτίε] the future perfect, i.q. cum a te factum erit vel
suen't.

1. 12. noant td fieri posse] i.e. ut semper ignotum futurum sit.

1. 18. nequaquam potent tu quidem] The MS reading is quam-
quam potest id quidem ‘though it is not so impossible neither,‘ as if
Cicero were asserting a dogma of the Academy ; but when speaking his
own sentiments as here, Cicero never impugns belief in divine provi-
dence‚ de nat. deor. 1§ 3, de leg. 1 ἓ 21, de fin. 1 ξ 5ῐ. Ι have adopted
therefore the conjecture of Manutius as most probable, considering that
Cicero had‚no reason for -abandoning his sentiments here. Moreover
the opposition implied in sed quaero, id si posset requires that a negation
should have preceded. On the omission of ficei aster potest cp. 11 ἓ 72
Tum· 1 ἕ 23 cuperem utrumque, si posset, ib. ὅ 77 qui potest? Qui
possit, rogas? Acad. 11 5 121 negas sine deo posse quiequam. See
Madvig cle fin. 1v ἓ 48, v 5 84. ΜῦΙΙει· however retains quamquam, in
which case translate z ‘it is certainly, as Ι maintain‚ possible: but (that
is not the question before us) Ι ask (assuming their point of view to be
- correct), what would they do, supposing what they say is impossible
were possible Ρ Μ. regards dis hominibusque as having nothing to do
with divine providence, but only to mean ‘all the world? Cf. ad sam.
1 9, 19.

1. 14. urguent rustice sane] ‘they stick to their assertion with
right boorish stubbornness, for they assert that the supposed case can
never arisg, and in this denial they persist.' Rustice (like Gr. ἀγροίκως
for ἀμαθῶς, ἀμούσως) ‘awkardly‚' ‘illiterately‚’ the opposite of urbane.
On urguent which is usually said of the aggressor, cp. de fin. 1v§ 77
urguent tamen et nihil remittunt, de orat. 1 ἕ 42 urgerent plzihso·
phorum greges, instaret Academia.

1. 15. hoo verbum quud valeat] ‘what is the soree of the expression
‘if possible' ’ (si posset, quidnam facerent). Cp. de Fin. 11 ¹3 quaerimus
verbam Latinum par Graeco et quod idem va leat, Tusc. v ἓ 24 quae
dixit, idem valent.

1. 18. tamquam tormenta. quaedam adhibemus] ‘we put them
as it were on the rack‚’ i.e. we apply a sort of test, to extract their real
sentiments. Cp. Plato Laches 188 Α τὸ βασανίζειν οὐ πρότερον ἀφήσει
Σωκράτης, πρὶν ἂν βασανίσῃ ταῦτα.

1. 20. fateantur]=cogantur fateri.
