quamvis seminarem] ‘ however intimate with him,’ 1 5 86.

1. e. populo quidem Romano non videtur] the qm‘dem restricts the
asser-tion to the particular word after which it is placed, and so gives
emphasis to it, ‘ as far as the public ol* Rome are concerned, they do not

says that opinions were divided about this (Ann. 1 8), and Suetonius
