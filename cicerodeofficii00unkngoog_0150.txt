ci patio imaginaria quaedam venditio-eaque res ita agitur: adhibitis

non minus quam quinque testibus, civibus Romanis puberibus et praeterea

alio eiusdem condicionis, qui libram aeneam teneat, qui appellatur libripens,

is qui mancipio accipit rem tenens ita dicit: Hunc ego hominem

(vel hanc rem) ex iure Quiritium meum esse aio, isque mihi

emptus est hoc aere aeneaque libra: deinde aere (i.e. nummo)

or (α) the property, right of absolute ownership‚ acquired hy such pur-

chase, so that he can alienate it at pleasure‚ especially a slave. Hence·
Lucretius 111 971 says vitaque mancipio nulli datur, omnibus usu, i. e.

nature gives none the mancipium cx iure Quiritium, the full and ab·

herself. Cp. Horace Epist. 11 2, 159—160 si proprium cst quod quis

libra mercatur et acre, quaedam si credis consultis, mancipat (⁸ gives a

title to') usus (i.q. usucapio).

By the ancient civil law things were divided into res mancipi and
res nec mancipi, i.e. ‘things which could,’ and ‘things which could not
be acquired as absolute property.' To the former belonged lands, slaveS,
and ordinary beasts of burden, such as horseS, oxen, muleS, &c. Maine

defect in question had not been unknown to Sergius, since he had before
sold the house in question, there was no reason for its being specified (on
occasion of the second transfer), and that the purchaser had not been
imposed upon, since he knew very well to what his purchase was
subject!
