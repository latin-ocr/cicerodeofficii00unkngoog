formula ut ‘ex fide bona’ iudicaret) Z. They concerned cases of
wardship, partnership, buying and selling, letting and hiring, trusts:
tutela, societas, emptio venditio, locatio conductio, fiduciae. See Long
Verres 1 p. 53.

1. 25. reliquorum iudiciorum] ‘of the remaining cases of iudicia
bonae fidei-⁹ .

haee verba excellunt] ‘the following words are prominent. '

1. 26. in asbltrio rei ux.] ‘in the case of arbitration about a wife’s
property.’ On the disposal of the dos when a marriage was dissolved
by death or divorce see Ramsay Roman Antiqq. p. 254 [p. 297 ed. of
1894]. Questions relating to the wife's property belonged to the
actiones bonae fidei, and were decided before arbitri. The addition
quantum melius aequius (an asyndeton for quantum melius et aequius)
indicates the claim as one not fixed and settled, but dependent upon
the arbiter’s judgment. Cp. pro Rosc- com. 5 12 quaero, quid—ita
arbitrum sumpseris, quantum aequius ct melius sit dari repromit-
tique,‘sic petiens, Top. 5 66 in omnibus igitur eis iudiciis, in quibus
‘ex fide bona’ est additum, ubi vcro ctiam ‘ut inter bonos bene
agicr‚’ inuprimisque in arbitrio rei uxoriae, in quo ast, ‘quod cius
melius aequius,' parati esse debent. The difference between iudicium
and arbitrium is given by Cicero pro Rosc. com. 5 10 iudicium est
pecuniae certae, arbitrium incertae .· ad i udi c ium hoc modo venimus,
ut totam litem aut obtineamus aut amittamus: ad arbitrium hoc
auimo adimus, ut neque· nihil neque tantum, quantum postulavimus,
consequamur: in trials before the praetor and iudices a fixed sum
was claimed and the suit was lost if not allowed in full, but in

cases of arbitration the sum demanded usually exceeded the sum
awarded.

Ρ. 2¹7, 1. 1. ln fiducia] ‘in the case of property alienated on eon-
dition of its being' restored-⁹ Fiducia was the term applied to a
, contract de dominio revocabili, when a man transferred his property to
another on condition that it should be restored to him: the person to
whom the property was so transferred was said fiduciam accipere
(Top. 5 42), and, if he did not restore it, was liable to an actio

fiduciae or fiducia ria, pro Rosc. com. 5 16, pro Caec. 5 7, de nat.
deor. 111 5 74 quoted on 5 61 1. 23.
