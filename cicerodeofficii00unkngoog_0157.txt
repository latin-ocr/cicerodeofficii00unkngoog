1. 12. scripserunt heredes secum] ‘made joint-heirs with them·
selves.’ It was a common manoeuvre with will-forgers to associate, for
the furtherance of their fraudulent Aesigm the names of some eminent
persons with their own.

tensius is attributed by Cornelius Nepos (vit. Att. 5) to their common

Cicero an Hortensius .· et id, quod erat difficillimmn, efficiebat, ut inter

himself to his duties as an advocate ς he died B.C. 50. Once only aster
his retirement did he appear in public, viz. B.c. 55, to oppose the
sumptuary law os Pompey and CrassuS, the repeal os which he obtained.
