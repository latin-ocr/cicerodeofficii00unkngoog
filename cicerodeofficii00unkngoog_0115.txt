that it is not possible there can be any benefit, where there is immorality. ’
Cp. 5 30 and 5 40.

1. 9. quod si nuru est cet] Cicero's argument is this :—‘ There
cannot be any inconsistency in Nature. But Nature teaches all rnen to
regard what is expedient, to shun what is morally wrong. Therefore if
the desire both of expediency and of moral good is a natural desire,
these must be naturally inseparable‚ at all events it is absurd to suppose
that expediency and moral wrong can be found in the same thing!
Observe that Cicero is here speaking of absolute, not apparent, ex-
pediency.

1. 10. convenientia—constantia] ‘things in accordance with our
rational nature,’ ‘harmony ’—‘ things in agreement with themselves,’
‘ consistency.'

1. 11. secundum naturam] ‘in conformity with nature.'

1. 18. nemque] The second syllogisrn, which differs but little
from the first. In both something that remains to be proved is supposed
as the foundation of the proof. The syllogisrn was the form of speech

in which the Stoics liked best to prove their positions and attack their
opponents. Cicero speaks (Tusc. 11 5 42) of the contortulae et minutae

conclusiunculae Stoicorum nec ad sensus permanantes.

1. 14. zenam] The founder of the Stoic sect, surnamed Citdeus,
from his birthplace cittium, a town in Cyprus. See above 5 ιι, 1 5 6.

corto] :profecta sine dubio, Gr. δηλονότι, ‘ assuredly,’ cp. Hand
Tursell. ιι p. 19.

omm pondere gravior] ‘ infinitely more important.’ A similar
expression is found de fin. 11 5 109 omnibus partibus maiores, where
Madvig observes ‘sic Latini loquuntur, curn id significant quod Ger-
manis est ‘unendlich gro'sserJ Est enim quasi ultimum et extremum
eius multiplicationis, qua multis partibus maius aliquid dicimus
(vielmal): conf. de Invent. 1 58 omn ibus partibus commodius,
Lucretius 1 735 inferiores partibus egregie m ultis.’ Cp. 5 11 minimi
momenti instar, and see N agelsb. lat. Stil. p. 37.

1. 16. necesse est, quod honestum oeta] The same syllogism asin
de fin. 111 5 27 quod est bonum, omne laudabile est, quod autem laudabile
est, omne est honestum, bonum igitur quod est, honestum est, cp. 11 5 10.

1. 18. ita] ‘ consequently.' lta is often used thus to mark a deduc-
tion from certain premises 3 as 1 5 10 i ta quam ille triplicem cet.. Tusc.
1 ἕ 12 si igitur non sunt, nih-il possunt esse: ita ue miseri quidem sunt,
5 58 animus, cum se conlegit atque recreavit, tum agnoscit illa remini·
