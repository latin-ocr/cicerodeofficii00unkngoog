Introduction xxi

read them himself. He begins by parading the opposing views
of the two philosopherS‚ and starts an imaginary dialogue be-
tween them (§§ 51—55)—-probably not his own invention but
that of some one who knew them thoroughly—and then (ἕξ 89-
91) puts some questions of conscience from the Sixth Book of
Hekat6n‚ who was a pupil of Panaetiu5‚ as Cicero tells us (ξ 63),
and therefore much younger than Diogenes and Antipater3 for
Antipater was a pupil of DiogeneS, and Panaetius himself of
Antipater. Among these problems of Hekaton is one (ξ 91)
about which there was a similar difference of opinion between
Diogenes ancl Antipater, as that about the preceding question.
This can only be explained by supposing that Hekaton ex-
patiates in his Sixth Book on the difference of opinion between
these two philosopher5‚ and that Cicero owes his knowledge of
the views of Diogenes and Antipater indirectly to Hekaton3 for
it is an absurdity to suppose that they—his elders—could have
come· to a decision on questions started by Hekaton‚ as must
be assumed from Cicero's representation. But if Cicero in this
one instance knew Diogenes and Antipater only indirectly
through Hekat6n‚ it may be taken for granted that this is the
case where he quotes them for the first time without naming
Hekaton. The opinions broached in ἓξ 21—32, with the
mention of Hercules and PhalariS, are altogether in the
spirit of the solutions ascribed to Hekaton in ᾗ 89f, and the
manner also of stating and solving the problems in ξ 29 coin-
cides with that peculiar to Hekaton. It appears then that
Cicero had no sources to rely on in his Third Book except
Poseidonius³⁶ and H ekat6n, the former of whom can scarcely be
considered such, and the latter perhaps not at all. For when we
remember that Cicero for his Third Book sent for a Poseidonius
and got his materials from Athenodorus Calvus the Stoic (see
p. viii n.>, and consider that it is hardly likely that he should
