reduced the silver denarius, which became from that time the true
standard of value, from ὴ to ᾖ· of a pound. It was this law which
established the salse principle of regarding gold and silvei· coinage
merely as a conventional sign of value‚ subject to ,the 'vvill of the
sovereign or the state. By means of the theory of the money-sign the
monied oligarchy of Rome produced grave perturbations in the mone-
tary system by falsifying the coinS. In each successive issue of denarii
there was a larger and larger proportion os plated pieces (i.e. of money
containing only a thin coating of the true metal over copperor iron),
until B.c. 9¹ M. Livius Drusus caused the Senate to pass a decision
that in future issues there should be one plated copper denarius-‚to
seven of silver. A few years later, in Cinna's time, the value of the
coinage had become so dubious that no one knew what hewas worth
(quid haberet). In B.C. -84 the tribunes os the people and the praetors
deliberated on the measures to be taken in order to remedy this de· ’
plorable state os things, An edict of the praetors instituted officers sor
the verification of the coinage, suppressed the enforced circulation'of
the plated denarii, ordered that they should bc withdrawn from the
public coffers and that denarii of a true standard should be given in
exchange. See an excellent Article on Money in Greece and Rome
