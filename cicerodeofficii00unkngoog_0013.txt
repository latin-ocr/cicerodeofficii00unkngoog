of spirit to which the writer gives vent without reserve on every
opportunity—and opportunities were not wanting in a work so
thoroughly practical as this—and his lamentation over the
extinction of freedom, and his own particular grievances. In

a subject, and his method of treating it. The present work is
his first attempt at the hortatory side of moral philosophy, and
the application os its principles to the regulation of conduct and
the intercourse of social and political life. Under the dictator-

and undisguised despotism of AntoniuS, it was natural that his
thoughts should be diverted from abstract discussions and
questions ‘o'n the chief good’ and ‘the being of the gods' to
those of practical interest. The de officiis is his last farewell to
his family and country.
