1. 1¹1. eae serviebant] ‘it (the house) was under a servitude) A
servitude is the liability of the property of one person to certain rights
of another estate or person over it. Servitus means either the liability
or the right to such a servitude. Servitutes were (ι) praedial or
real, (2) personal. Praedial servitudes were the liabilities osone
estate or building (res serviem ‘the servient tenement') to the superior
rights of another estate or building (res dominans ‘the dominant tene-
ment’). They were divided into rural and urban3 the former affect-
ing the land itself, as the right of way, whether (a) footpath or
bridle-road (iter), (b) carriage-road (actus), (c) highway (via),
right of aqueduct (aquaeductus); the latter, attached to buildings
raised on the soil, as on the part of the dominant tenement the servitude
of support (oneris ferendi) giving a right to rest the building on part of
the contiguous property, of fixing a joist or beam in a neighbour's
wall (ius tigni immittendi), the liability to receive rain-water from roos
or gutter (ius stillicidii vel fluminis recipiendi). Personal servi-
tudes were those which were enjoyed immediately by a particular
person, without being attached to an estate, whereas real servitudes are
appurtenant to lands. The easements of the English law correspond
in some respect with the servitudes of Roman law. See Lord
Mackenzie Studies in Roman Law p. 183 ff„ Ramsay Roman Antiq.
