Ρ. 82, 5 ua, 1. 1. decom 1111 cot] The same story is told ῐ 5 40.
Aulus Gellius N. A. v11 18 says that two of the ten returned, and that
their fraudulenta calliditas was reckoned so turpis that they were con-
tempti vulgo discerptique, and that the censors (one of whom according
to Valerius Maximus 11 ix 8 was the son of the Regulus just mentioned)
visited them afterwards omnium notarum et damnis et agnominis,
quoniam, quod facturos ᾰείαναῡεηιηί, non fecissent. See also Livy
xxn c. 61.

minnan-avissent] 5 112 l. 18.

1. 4. ³1 non redieram] ‘if it is true that they did not return)

are osten omitted 5 120 l. 15.

optumum auctorem, i-e. fide dignissimum. PolybiuS, the eminent
historiari, native of Megalopolis in Arcadia, was born about B.C. 204.
He was a leading man in the Achaean league after Philopoemen and
one of the 1000 Achaeans sent to Rome to answer the charge of not
having assisted the Romans against Perseus. At Rome he remained
seventeen years in the house of Aemilius Paulus, of whose son, Scipio
Africanus minor, he became the tutor and 'friend; joined him in his
campaign at Carthage and was present at the destruction of that city
B.C. 146. His history consisted of sorty books, of which five only
survive in their entirety. The first book describes the First Punic War.

The rest comprises a period of seventy·two years, beginning with the
second Punic war κο. 218, and ending with the fall of Corinth Rc, 146.
