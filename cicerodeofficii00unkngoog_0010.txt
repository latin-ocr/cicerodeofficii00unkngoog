vi Preface

references in the notes which presupposed the entire work
to be in the hands of the reader. Moreover, though the
object of so separating the book was to suit the convenience
' of a different class of Students to that which would probably

require the whole book, the notes were the same, neither
retrenched nor made plainer. In this case therefore Ι have
had something more to do. Ι have not found it easy to
steel myself often to the making of large excisionS, though
I have done so in certain places, but Ι have occasionally
simplified the notes 3 have either cut out mere reference8‚
or, when they seemed necessary, have given the passages at
length ; have removed a considerable number of errors3

and have now and then put in a few words or illustrations
which I thought would make the meaning clearer. F inally
Ι have made a separate index to the notes and shortened
the Introduction (which Dr Holden acknowledged to have
taken to a great extent from C. F. W. Miiller) so as to
make it bear rather'more exclusively on the Third Book.

I have also corrected some of the spelling of the Text
in conformity with recent authorities,
