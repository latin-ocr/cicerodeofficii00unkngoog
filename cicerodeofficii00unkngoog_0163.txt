vel micare iussisse, ut allerutn' concederetur. The word micare was
applied to a simple game of the Romans which is still common enough
among their descendants and called la morra, in French la mourre.
The game is this: of two persons one, at a given-signal, quickly opens
any number os his fingers. At the same moment the other endeavours
to match his opponent by opening the same number. In the light, of
course, each could see, as soon as it was done, whether the guess was
rig'ht. In the dark, honesty would be the only check to deception:
hence to play with a man in the dark implied full confidence in him.
