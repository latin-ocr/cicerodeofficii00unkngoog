Ρ. 88, 1. 1. communitate] ‘social life,’ vitae quasi communitas
1 ἓ 20. cernuntur] ‘are visible‚’ 1 ἓ 66 fortis animus duabus rebus
maxime cernitur.

1. 2. noque emm bonitas—esse potest—³1 haee non per se expe-
tantur] See Madvig Gr. 5 348 e obs. 3, who quotes Caes. B. C. 111 44
Caesar munitiones prohibere non poterat, uisi proelio decertare vellet, as
another similar example of a conditional proposition in the conjunctive
being subjoined to one containing non possum with· the infinitive. Cp.
also de fin. 1 § 54 ne ipsarum quidem virtutum lans—reperire potest
exilum, nisi dirigatur ad voluptatem.

1. 3. non plus15381> 3, §89l· 17.
amicitia] Friendship is according to Epicurus one of the greatest

blessings of life, de fin. 1 65 Epicurus ita dicit omnium rerum, quas ad
beate vivendum sapientia comparaverit, nihil esse maius amicitia, nihil
uberius, nihil iucundius ; so that the wise man ought to be ready to
sacrifice his lise for his friend; but in conformity with his fundamental
principle that nothing but pleasure is in itself worthy, he taught that
friendship was limited by pleasure, i.e. the advantages which it confers,

1. 4. conferamus in paneas Quae multis verbis disputavimus, paucis
complectamur. H. Plautus Menaech. prolog. 6 in'verba cons eram

paucissima.

5 119, 1. 6. omnem voluptatem honestati osse contrariam] Such
at least was the doctrine of the staunchest Stoicsz Sext. Empir. adv.
math. xl 73 Κλεάνθης μὲν μήτε κατὰ φύσιν αὐτὴν (τὴν ἡδονὴν) εἶναι μήτε
ἀξίαν ἔχειν αὐτὴν έν τῷ βίᾳ-Παναίτιος δέ τινα μὲν κατὰ φύσιν ὑπάρχειν,
τινὰ δὲ παρὰ φύσιν. Cicero has in view chiefly gross sensual indulgence,
as is the case in all his attacks upon the Epicurean system.

1. 8. camphonem et Dinomachum] Calliphon and Dinoma-
ch us tried to follow a middle path between the Stoics and EpicureanS,
considering the chief good to consist in the union of virtue with bodily
pleasure. Clem. Alex. Strom. 11 ἕ 128 explains the doctrine further :—
κατὰ τοὺς παρὰ Καλλιφῶν τα ἕνεκα μὲν τῆς ἡδονῆς παρεισῆλθεν ἡ ἀρετή,
χρόνῳ δὲ ὕστερον τὸ περὶ αὐτὴν κάλλος κατιδοῦσα ἰσότιμον ἑαυτὴν τῇ ἀρχῇ
τούτεστι τῇ ἡδονῇ παρέσχεν, i.e. pleasure and virtue are both of them
ends to man, but pleasure is so from the first, while virtue only becomes
so aster experience. Cp. de fin. v ἓ 21 iunctae autem et duplices expo-
sitiones summi boni tres omnino fuerunt...Nam aut voluptas adiungi
polest ad honestatem, ut Calliphonti Dinomachoque placuit,
aut doloris vacuitas, ut Diodoro, aut prima naturae ut Academicis
