5 61, 1. 17. magoni] Diogenes Babylonius was a native of
Seleucia iu Babylonia, pupil of Chrysippus (chryssppi auditor, de div.
1 5 6), and preceptor of Antipater of Tarsus. He was one of the three
ambassadors (the other two being Karneades the Academic and Krito·
laus the Peripatetic philosopher) from Athens to Rome (B.c. 156), who

at the instance of Cato were required to withdraw in haste, lest the
Roman youth should be spoiled through their philosophy, Tusc. 1v 5 5,

Aulus Aellius vn 14, Pliny N. H. vn 5 ιη. The visit of the three

philosophers to Rome is remarkable as having done much to inspire the
Romans with a taste for Greek literature.

magno et gravi Stoico] 11 5 51 gravissimo Stoicorum Panaetio.

Antipatro] sc. videtur or videntur. Antipater of Tarsus was a
pupil of Diogenes (de fin. 1 5 6), and master of Panaetius (Panaetii
magister, de div. 1 5 6). He was a zealous opponent of the Academic5‚

” of whose dialectic‚ however, he had such a sear that he would never

commit himself to a viva voce dispute with them, whence his nickname
ὁ καλαμοβόας, ‘the pen'·shouter,' Acad. post. fr. 17, 11 55 17, 28, 109.
His opinion rests here and in 5 91 on the claims of moral laW, to which
the maxim, that each person is a member of the community and must
not do anything which is injurious to it, is referred, whereas Diogenes
holds by commercial law. He was prior in age to the Antipater men-
tioned in 11 5 86.

1. 21. iure civili] ‘the common law of the land,' i.q. legibus popu·
lorum, quibus in singulis civitatibus res publica continetur 5 2 3.

quomam vendat] ‘ since he is the seller,' ‘ since he has on sale.’

care, vilissime vendere, cp. 5 61 l. 20 ut emat melius.
