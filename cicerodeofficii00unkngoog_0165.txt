1. τ’. ducere] i.e. producere, trahere, ‘that he was protracting.'
Illum refers of course to Metellus, although the simple pronoun of
reference eum had been used in speaking of him before in the same
sentence: the reason is, that another subject intervenes viz. populum

Romanum, hence the necessity for a more distinct reference in mentiou-
ing Metellus.

si—fecissent] For tense see ἓ 77 1. 14n.

1. 9. redacturum] Sall. l.c. represents Marius as saying dimidia
pars exerc-titus si sibi permitteretur, paucis diebus Iugurtham in catenis
habiturum, ab imperatore consulto trahi, quod homo inanis et regiae
superbiae impm’o nimis gauderet.

1. 10. qui—adduxerit] causal subjunctive, ‘because he brought
into odium by a false accusation.’

1. 11. cuius legatus esset] This is repeated for the purpose of
marking more strongly the impiety of the act laesio mandati. It was

Ι considered as a breach of piety for a former legatus to appear as a
witness in a court of justice against his imperator.

ξ 80, 1. 13. ne noster quidem Gratidianus] i.e. ne noster (‘my
relative ’) quidem Marius, nempe Gratidianus, 9 67. M. Marius
GratidianuS‚ son of M. Gratidius, adopted son of a brother of the
famous Marius (de leg. 111 δ 36). He was praetor B.c. 86 and for the
second time 13.c. 82. His edictum concerning the coinage (see below
note to 1. 15) made him very popular, so that statues were raised in all
the public places to the author of so beneficent a reform, and almost
divine honours were paid to these statues by burning incense and wax
tapers before them. Sulla visited him with cruel retribution sor this
popularity. He was a sormidable political adversary‚ and in the eyes
of the aristocratic party had committed a veritable crime in assailing a
right of the State to alter the value of the coinage. As soon therefore
as'the dictator entered Rome, all the statues of Gratidianus were
overthrown, and he himself proscribed and cruelly murdered, Cic. de
pet. cons. ξ 10, Seneca de ira 111 18, Lucan Phars. 11 174 ff.

1. 1⁶. adhibuissent] sc. in consilium, ‘he summoned to counsel‚’
‘consulted,' 1 5 147 adhe· bere doctos homines et quid his placeat ex·
quarere.

ut res numana—constitueretur] ‘in order that the currency might
have its value defined and settled,' ‘its standard fixed by a joint re·
solution.' The lex Flaminia, passed at a great crisis of peril to the
Republic, when Hannibal was almost at the gates os the city, suddenly
