desire for the elevation of his fellow-citizenS. The interpretation
of writers on Greek philosophy, and the general diffusion and
reduction to popular language of their great thoughts so as to
give them general currency, was the one service he could now

true that he is so far dependent upon his original Greek sourceS,
that the scheme and plan of the whole work is borrowed from
them and general questions raised in them are not excluded24.
But when he is writing independently, not only are his examples
and illustrations borrowed from Roman History and from the
