Aeginetis] Aelian var. hist. 11 9 οἷα ἐψηφίσαντο Ἀθηναῖοι-καὶ ταῦτα
ἐν δημοκρατίᾳ, Αἰγινητῶν μὲν ἑκάστου τὸν μέγαν ἀποκόψαι τῆς χειρὸς
δάκτυλον τῆς δεξιᾶς, ἵνα δόρυ μὲν βαστάζειν μὴ δύνωνται κώπην δὲ ἐλαύνειν
δύνωνται. The decree must have been passed on occasion either of the
subjection of Aegina (B.C. 456) or of the expulsion of the Aeginetans
(B.c. 431)= but neither Thucydides (1 108, 11 27) nor Diodorus (XI 76,
ΧΠ 44) refer to any such decree. Aegina, anciently called Oenone,
was an island in the Sinus Saronicus (the modern guls of Engia), close
to the PiraeuS. Hence Pericles said that it must be destroyed, because
it was λήμη τοῦ Πειραιῶς, i-e. ‘an eyesore to the Piraeus’ (Plutarch
Pericl. c. 8). Its Dorian inhabitants were expelled and allowed by
the Spartans to settle in Cynuria, but were restored by Lysander in
nc, 404 [Xen. Hell. 11 α, 5—9J.

1. 21. urbibus uti] ‘to have the advantage of cities,' i.e. to settle
there and carry on their business, as in a fixed home, 1 5 135. The
more usual construction of verbs such as prohibeo is with quin or quo-
minus, followed by the conjunctive, 1158, Zumpt Gr. 5 544, Madvig
Gr. 5 375 a obs. α. sse practice of ξενηλασία or ‘alien acts' was
generally condemned amongst the ancientS, the Spartans were very
exclusive in this respect, see Her. lx 35, Thucyd. 1 144, 11 39, Arist.
Pax 624, Xen. rep. Lac. 143 and cp. Liv. XLI 24 where the decree
of the Achaeans excluding the Macedonians is called execrabilis· desertio
iuris humani.

1. 22. Pennus] sc. prohibuit usu urbis. M. Junius PennuS,
tribune os the Commons 13.C. 126. See Brut. 5 109 M. Pennus facile
agitavit in tribunatu C. Gracchum paullum aetate antecedens. Fuit
enim Μ. Lepido et L. Oreste coss, (13.0. 125) quaestor Gracchus, tribunus
Pennus, illius M. filius, qui cum Q. Aelio consul fuit: sed is onznia
summa sperans aedilitias est mortuus. Plutarch (C. Gracch. c. 3)
compared with A. Gellius (xv 12) furnishes a comment on this passage.
We have a notice of his law de peregrinis in Festus p. 286 res publicas
multarum civitatum pluraliter dixit C. Gracchus in ea quam cmmjosit
de lege Penni de peregrin is. Beier conjectures that the name Pennus
is a copyist's error sor Fannius, to whom Cicero refers Brut. c. 26
C. Fannii, C. F. qui consul cum Domitio (uc. 123) fuit, oratio de sociis
et nomine Latino contra Gracchum.
