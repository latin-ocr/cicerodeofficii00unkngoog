was on terms of friendship with Clodius, Cicero’s bitterest enemy, and
had prevented his condemnation (ad Att. 1 16, 5), and therefore had
neither opposed Cicero’s banishmegt nor worked for his return. Still
Crassus sought to be reconciled with Cicero aster his return (Plut. Cic.
33). and an apparent reconciliation took place between them before ’
Crassus’ departure sor Asia: ad sam. ibid. cum Pompeius ita con-

· tendis-set, ut nihil umquam magis, ut cum Crasso redirem in gratiam,—

habui non temporum solum rationem meorum, sedetiam naturae, Cras·
susque, ut quasi testata populo Romano esset nostra grotta, paene a meis -
Laribus in provinciam est prcffectus.

Π. Satrium] called aster his adoption M. Minucius Basilus
Satrianus. He was a confederate of Antonius, spoken· os con-
temptuously by Cicero Phil. 11 ἕ 107 as patronus of Italian townships:
vexavit (Antonius) Puteolanos, quod C. Cassium et Brutos patronos
adoptassent. Magno quidem studio, imlz'cio, benevolentia, caritate, non
ut te (sc. Antony) et Basilum vi et armis et alios vestri similes, quos
clientes nemo habere velit, non modo illorum cliens esse. He is doubtloes
a different man from the L. Minucius Basilus, who served as legatus of
Caesar in his Gallie wars and is spoken of as one of his murderers by
Appian 11 113, Cic. ad sam. vt 15.

1. ΞΟ. nomen suum serre] sc. by adoption.

1. 21. o turpem notam temporum [nomen morum] is the reading
of the MSS. But Cicero cannot possibly have meant to speak of the
name Basilus (βασιλεύς) (which was common in the gens Minucia, as
Rex and Regulus in other samilies) as a turpis nota temporum, the
worst he could see in it was a malum omen. Nomen illorum is evidently
a comment introduced by some scribe, who did not understand that the
exclamation refers to the preceding patronum agri Piceni. It is a dis-
grace that stateS‚ who enjoyed the Roman civitas, should choose a
patronus, like conquered people (1 3 3 5), and, in Cicero's view, that they
should choose such men as Antony and SatriuS, rather than Brutus and
Cassius. Moreover illorum cannot be right, because, as Satrius was
still patronus at the time when Cicero wrote this, he must have written
temporum bomem.
