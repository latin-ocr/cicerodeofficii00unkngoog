Hamilcar, who was commander-in-chief at the battle os Tunis B.c. 055,
had already conducted the war not without some result in Sicily, while
Hamilcar Bareas, Hannibal's father, took the supreme command in
Sicily when he was quite a young man, B.c. 247, and had not arrived at

1. 2. captivi nobiles] In the great victory won hy L. Caecilius
Metellus at Panormus B.c. 250 thirteen noble Carthaginians had been
taken prisoners and led in triumphal procession. The Carthaginians,
wishing to recover these and others of their citizens, sent an embassy to
Rome to propose an exchange of prisonem, and M. Regulus was
allowed to accompany the ambassadors upon his promise given to
return with them to Carthage, is the negotiation failed. (Pyrrhus had
given a similar permission to his Roman prisoners.) But Regulus,
thinking that the proposed exchange would he to the advantage of the
Carthaginians, nobly dissuaded the senate from consenting to it: ‘ he
himself would be ill-exchanged,' he said, ‘ for a Carthaginian general in
full health and strength, for the Carthaginians, he believed, had given
him a secret poison and he felt that he could not live long.' The
exchange was refused: Regulus returned to Carthage and soon after
died. His springs of lise had been poisoned, not by the deliberate
crime of the CarthaginianS‚ but by mortification, shame, a pining aster
his country and the common miseries of a prisoner’s condition, at a
period when the courtesies of war were unknown. Afterwards the story
prevailed, that the Carthaginians in their disappointment had put him to
a death of linger-ing torment; but the story is probably untrue. Asnold's
