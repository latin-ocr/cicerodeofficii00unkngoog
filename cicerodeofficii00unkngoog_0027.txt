examples are not always relevant, see ξ 114, ξ 117. The whole
Book in short has the appearance of being less a scientific and

systematic treatise than the improvised lively small talk of a

subject of probity in dealing with men.

The text of the present Edition agrees in the main with
that of C. F. W. Miiller in his Second Edition with German
notes fiir den Schulgebrauclz, Leipzig 18823 the First Edition in
the Teubner Series with critical N oteS, 1879, differs from this
in some of its readings, The following is a list of the readings
in Mfiller2, not adopted in my edition and unnoticed in my
critical footnotes in, which 1 have recorded the variants of the
other principal editions :—
