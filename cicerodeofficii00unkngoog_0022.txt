xviii Introduction

To teach men moraIS, who have faults and are accordingly,
in the strict Stoic vieW, incorrigible fools and sinners‚ is in itself
an incongruity‚ which however did not prevent either Zeno 01
Chrysippus from discoursing on moral duties ; but Panaetius
and his school took a less exalted view of general morality,
descending to the level of common life35. And there were other
Stoics also before Panaetius, who relaxed some of the rigour
of their school.

We cannot be surprised that this modification of Stoicism
should have become fashionable at Rome, and Cicero needed no
special justification for associating himself with the ethical
teaching of a school which had the reputation—however little
deserved-—of making such strong claims on the morals of its
adherentS. The necessity of living virtuous lives and avoiding
vice was taught by all schools alike; they differed only as to the
‘why and wherefore.' The Stoics in their exalted notions of
virtue and contempt of external thingS, which they would not
allow to be good, went too far for ordinary men, they made
themselves only too good3 and their big phrases consequently
were mere empty soundS, in which no one believed.

ξ 5 Sources of tlte treatise and its subject

We have Cicero's own confession in several passages that
the treatise of Panaetius [ob. Rc. 112] Περὶ τοῨ καθήκοκτοο
was his sons primarius in the present work3 see especially 111 2
quenz nos correctione quadam adhibita potissimum secuti sumus.

³⁵ Sometimes they went so far as to enunciate principles which are
questionable even according to the vulgar notions of morality‚ as in
1 10, 32 nec promissa egitur servanda sunt ea quae sint eis, quibus
promiseris, inutilia, nec, si plus tibi ea noceant, quarn illi prosint cui
promiseris, contra (fficium est maius anteponi minori, and 11 14, 51
patroni est non numquam veri simile, etiamsi minus sit verum, dffendere,
upon which Cicero observes z—quocl scribere, praesertim cum de philo·
sophia scriberem, non auderem, nisi idem placeret gravissimo Stoicorum
Panetio,——and 111 29, 107 on mental reservation in taking an oath.
