x Introduction

in B.C. 51, he crossed to Greece and, being then in his six-
‘ teenth year, joined the army of Pompeius, from whom he

·received the command of a squadron of cavalry, and won
the good opinion of his general and the whole army by his
skill in military exercises and manly endurance of labour4. In
Re. 45 he had a great desire to proceed to Spain and take part
in the service of Caesar against his former friends. His father,
however, refused to gratify his desire and sent him instead to
Athens⁶ to prosecute his studies there along with several other
young Romans of distinguished family⁶. At AthenS, although
provided with a most liberal allowance ⁷, he fell into extravagant
habits; but afterwards he reformed his mode of life and became
a diligent student of philosophy under Cratippus of Mitylene,
who was at that time head of the Peripatetic Schoolss. After the
death of Caesar, he was raised to the rank of military tribune
by BrutuS, and did much good service in the course of the
Macedonian campaign⁹. The attainder pronounced upon the
father was extended to the son aISO, but the Triumvirs were not
able to injure him. When his party was broken up by the rout
at Philippi, he joined Sextus Pompeius in Sicily and taking
advantage of the amnesty in favour of exiles—which was part of
the convention between that chief and the triumvirate—returned
to Rome. Here he lived in retirement, until Octavianus paid
the debt he owed his father by assuming the son as his colleague
in the Consulship in B.c. 30 after his final rupture with AntoniuS.
