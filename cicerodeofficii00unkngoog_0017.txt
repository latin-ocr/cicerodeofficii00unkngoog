Introduction xiii

 

in a description of the sublime enjoyment arising from the
pursuit of liberal knowledge1⁹‚ but he is constantly under the
apprehension lest in his exclusive devotion to philosophy he
should be considered by some viri boni to be serving merely
personal and not social endS. Hence his frequent and elaborate
apologies for this method of spending the leisure which ex-
clusion from the political arena had forced upon him20. To
drown his care in the pursuit of pleasure and abandon himself
to careless indolence, like so many eminent men of his party,
would have been altogether repugnant to his taste and un-
worthy of a man of his cultivation. He turned then to Philosophy
—which had been a favourite study of his youth and to which,
in the midst of active life, he had given up all the time that he
could spare from professional and political duties21—as a grate·
ful relief from distracting recollections and a consolation in a
period of deepest g100m22. But he did not turn to it merely on
personal grounds or for his own amusement and satisfaction:

1⁹ de fin. 1 i 3 nec modus est ullus investigandi veri, nisi inveneris, et
quaerendi defiztzgatio turpis est, cum id, quod quaeritur, sit pulcherri-
mum. Etenim si delectamur, cum scribimus, quis est tam invidus, qui
ab eo nos abducat ? sin laboramus, quis est qui alienae modum statuat indus-
tr'iae, ‘not only is discovery the sole limit to the exploration of truth‚ but
when the object of search is the noblest possible, weariness in the search
becomes disgraceful. Further‚ is writing is a pleasure to me, who is so
grudging as to draw me away from it? or if it is a task, who is there
that should set a bound to another man’s activity?’ Cf. Acad. 11 ξ 7.

²⁰ See de off. 1 i 2—-ii 6, Acad. 11 ii 6. At Rome such studies were

looked upon as only fit sor the amusement of Greeks and wealthy dilet-
tanti, quite unworthy of a Roman statesman.

²¹ Cf. de div. 11 ii 7 tribuenda est opera reipublicae vel omnis potius
in ea cogitatio et cura ponenda ,· tantum huic studio relinquendum, quan-
tum vacabit a publico officio et munere. The same thought is constantly
cropping up in the de oſjiciis. See 11 ἓ 4 f.

²² de divin. 11 ii 6 ac mihi quidem explicandae philosophiae causam
adtulit casus gravis civitatis, cum in armis civilibus nec tueri meo more
rem publicam nec nihil agere poteram nec, quid potius, quod quidem me
dignum esset, agerem, reperiebam. Cf. de off. 111 i 1—4.
