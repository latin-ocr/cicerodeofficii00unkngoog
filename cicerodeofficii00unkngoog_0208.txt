philosophical school. Our principal source of information respecting
him is the tenth book of Diogenes LaertiuS, besides the philosophical
poem of Lucretius de rerum natura. Cicero, de finibus and de natura
deorum, writes in a hostile spirit about his philosophy and nnjustly
brands him as a man devoted to sensual pleasures. Diogenes calls him
πολυγραφώτατος and gives a list of the best of his works together with
some os his letters and the κύριαι δόξαι, i.e. peculiar propositions,
containing the substance of his ethical philosophy. His most important
work was that περὶ φύσεως in 37 bookS‚ parts of which were discovered
among the rolls at Herculaneum and have been published. Epicurus
prided himself upon being αὐτοδίδακτος, but he was in reality indebted
both to Democritus and to the CyrenaIcs. His ethical system arose from
the peculiar circumstances of his time, when, in the absence-of political
freedom, thinking rnen endeavoured to establish an internal freedom
based upon ethical principles: they regarded perfect independence,
sels-reliance‚ and contentment as the summum bonum, following the
dogma of the Cyrenaics that pleasure constitutes the highest happiness
and consequently must be the end of all human exertions. But pleasure
with him was conceived of not as a mere momentary and transitory
,sensatiombut as something lasting„which consisted in pure and noble
mental enjoyments‚ and {reedom from pain and disturbing influences
(ἀταραξία and dvrovla),—peace of mind based upon φρόνησις, which he

described as the beginning of everything good, as the origin of all ·

virtues, and even as the summum bonum itself. In the physical part =
of his philosophy he adopted the atomic theory of Democritus, as we
know srom Lucretius. His ethical doctrines were much mistaken in
after ages, and made to minister to mere sensuality., At Rome, owing
to the paramount influence of the Stoical philosophy, they never took
firm root. See Dict. qs Gr. and Rom. Biogr. Vol. 11 p. 33 ff„ Zeller
