to be deceived and like to be credulous’14. We are also told by ,
Plutarch¹⁵ that Cicero felt himself compelled ‘to prohibit Gorgias
the Rhetorician from associating with him, charging him with
inciting the young man to sensual pleasures and drink.' Where-
upon he writes to Tire, his father’s secretary (perhaps with some
hypocrisy)1⁶: ‘As to what you say in your letter about GorgiaS‚
though Ι found him in fact useful to me in my daily declama-
tionS, Ι have preferred to obey my father's injunctions before
every other consideration. For he had written ordering me in so
many words to dismiss him on the spot. I did not wish to make
any difficulty about it for fear that any expression of strong feel-
ing on my part should rouse some suspicion in him. Besides
it occurred to me that it would be presumptuous to express an
opinion on a formal judgment of my father'S.' That there was
reason for anxiety is further shown by a remark of the elder
Seneca¹⁷, who in relating an anecdote of his having as Pro-
consul in Asia given orders to scourge the Rhetorician CestiuS,
one of his own guests, describes him as ‘a man who had none
of his father's intellectual gifts except his wit‚’ and says that
‘nature had'deprived him of a good memory and addiction to
wine was then stealing away what little he had left.²

ξ 3 Τ lte general plan and purpose of the work

· Cicer0, like a true Roman, had little taste for abstract specu-
lationS‚ except so far as they bore upon work-day life and served
some useful end ; it was the practical side only of philosophy
that enlisted his sympathy. He had originally looked upon it
as a constituent element of general culture, especially indis-
pensable to the youthful aspirant to the honours of the forum
and the senate13. His earlier workS, the de re publica (3.0. 54)
and the de legibus (Rc. 52), are to be classed among his political
rather than his philosophical writingS. He occasionally indulges
