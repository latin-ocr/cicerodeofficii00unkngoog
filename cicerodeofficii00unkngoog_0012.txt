viii Introduction

back by stress of weather. This allusion, however, does not
furnish us with the exact date of the composition of the present
work, because Cicero is here speaking only of his disappoint-
ment in not having paid his intended visit to his son at Athens.
We do not learn from it when the book was actually finished..
Evidence of this must be sought elsewhere.

There were two occasions in the year 13.c. 44 when Cicero
urbe relicta rura peragravit—one from the beginning of April
to the end of August, the other from October to the 9th of
December. The question ariseS, which of the two is meant in
ξ 1. His correspondence throws light upon this point. In a
letter to Atticus from his villa near Puteoli dated Oct. 25th
(Att. XV 13, 6) he tells his friend that he is busy with the work:
Nos hic φιλοοσῲοῨΛΛεΝ (quedenim aliud ?)—et†el Περὶ τοῨ naen-i-
κοΝτοο magnifice explicamus προοῴωΝοῨΛΛεΝᾳιιε Ciceroni, qua
de re enim potius pater filio? deinde alia: quid quaeris? exstabit
opera peregrinationis huius. On November the 5th he writes
again to Atticus² that he had then completed the two first books
and was engaged upon the third. To judge from the mar-
vellous rapidity with which Cicero composed his philosophical
writingS, it is highly probable that the Third Book was com-
pleted before his second return to Rome and appearance in
open opposition to AntoniuS.

This supposition will justify and account for the bitterness*

² Att. xvl 11, 4 τὰ περὶ τοῦ καθήκοντος, quatenus Panaetius, absolvi
duobus: illius tres sunt, sed, cum initio divisisset ita, tria genera exqui-
rendi officii esse, unum, cum deliberemus honestum an turpe sit, alterum,
utile an inutile, tertium, cum haec inter se pugnare videantur, quomodo
iudicandum sit, qualis causa Reguli, redire honestum, manere utile, de
duobus primis praeclare disseruit, de tertio pollicetur se deinceps, sed nihil
scripsit. Eum locum Posidonius persecutus cst, ego autem et eius librum
arcessivi et ad Athenodorum Calvum scripsi, ut ad me τὰ κεφάλαια mit-
teret—quae expecto ,· quem velim cohortere et roges ut quam prim um—-: in
eo est περὶ τοῦ κατὰ περίστασιν καθήκοντος. Cicero appears to have
received these τὰ. κεφάλαια before the middle of the month; sor he
writes (14, 3) Athenodorum nihil est quod hortere: misit en im satis
bellum ὑπόμνημα.
