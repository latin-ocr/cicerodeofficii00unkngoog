CHAPTER IV

1. 16. quani secunda. quaedam] i.q. secundaria, ⁶ a sort of second·

grade moral duties.’ Quasi serves to modify the expression secunda
honesta used to express what the Stoics called μέσα καθήκοντα, not

δεύτερα καλά. quaedam serves to show that the word does not exactly
convey the writer's meaning, or is not strong enough.

1. 18. communia] above§ 14, 1. ι.

9 1ο, 1. 19. virtutis indoles] i.q. similitudo honesti, incohata virtus,
in opp. to perfect and complete virtue.

1. 20. commoventur] ‘ are influenced‚’ cp. ἓ 35 1. 5.

duo Βοιὼ] cp. 1 ἓ 61 where also they are mentioned together with
the two Scipios, The father devoted himself for the good of his country
in the Latin War 13.c. 340 (Liv. vm 9, Cic. de div. ι 5 51, Herenn.
lv 44), the son in the Samnite War (13.c. 295).

dno scipiones] the elder and younger Africanus.

used just before3 aut is omitted in some MSS, and the best MSS of
Lactantius inst. div. vl 6, 26, where this passage is quoted, have ab hoc,
not ab his.

1. 23. tamquam a. sapiente] ‘ as though from the ideal perfect man
of the Stoic8.' The Stoics attached such supet-human excellences to
their sapiens, that their leading philosophers scarcely ever ventured to
name any person as having actually attained to them. Cf. Tusc. 11 5 5¹

in quo vero erit perfecta sapientia, quem adhuc nos quidem vidimus
mneinm, sed philosophorum sententiis, qualis hic futurus sit, si modo
aliquandofiterit‚ exponitur. See ἓ 14 l. 29 ιι.

Η. cato] M. Porcius Cato Sapiens the Censor, de am. ἓ 6
quasi cognomen iam habebat in senectute Sap i en tis, ς 9 aut enim
