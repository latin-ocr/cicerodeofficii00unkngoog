Introduction xi

It was during his Consulship that the decree was passed for
destroying all the statues and monuments of Marcus Antonius3
so that, as Plutarch remarkS, the completion of the triumvir's ’
punishment was reserved by divine justice for the house of
Cicero ¹⁰. On the expiration of his term of office, he was made
Proconsul of Asia.

Besides the negative indication afforded by the absence of any
recognition of his son’s progress in his studies and fulfilment of
his father’s hopes—there are sundry positive though slight indi-
cations in the present work11, which lead us to suspect that
Cicero had reason for believing that he could not choose a fitter
subject of instruction for his son than that of ‘propriety of con-
duct' or ‘moral duties.’ This suspicion is confirmed by isolated
hints in his letters to his friend Atticus, that the son's manner of
life was a subject of anxiety to him. At one time he writes:
‘You have written to my son just the sort of letter I should have
wished him to receive: its tone could not be more uncompro-
mising nor at the same time more strictly moderate'12. And
again: ‘It is of great importance to my son, or rather to
myselss——or rather by heaven to us both, that I should visit him
while engaged in his studies. For as to Leonidas's letter, which
you forwarded to me, what is there in it to be much pleased at?
1 shall never think commendation satisfactorily expressed in
such a phrase “as he is going on at present.'' That is not the
language of confidence but of apprehension'13. In the middle
of June in the same year B.C. 44 he writes: ‘At last a letter-
-carrier from my son! And upon my word his letter is without
his usual oratorical flourishes, which of itself shows some
improvement. The others also write in high terms. Leonidas
indeed still sticks to his favourite “as yet‚'' but Herodes is very
complimentary. Qua voulez-vous? In this matter I am glad

¹⁰ vit. Cic. c. 49 ἐφ’ οὗ τάς τ’, εἰκόνας ἀνεῖλεν ἡ βουλὴ τοῦ Ἀντωνίου καὶ
τὰς ἄλλας ἁπάσας ἠκύρωσε τιμὰς καὶ προσεψηφίσατο μηδενὶ τῶν Ἀντωνίων

ὄνομα Μάρκον εἶναι. Οὕτω τὸ δαιμόνιον εἰς τὸν Κικέρωνος οἶκον
ἐπανήνεγκε τὸ τέλος τῆς Ἀντωνίου κολάσεως.
