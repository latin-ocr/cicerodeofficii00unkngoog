1. 18. ut excellas] con-cessive subjunctive, ‘though you should sur-

pulchritudine et viribus] According ‚to the doctrine of Zeno (Diog.
Laert. vu 107) εὐφυΐα and ἰσχύς, ‘beauty and strength,’ had in them-
selves (δι’ αὐτὰ) a value and consequently would have the smne in

5 20, 1. 23. aut mnu existimat] i.e. hoc facit, aut quod nihil ex-
istimat cet. There are two cases (1) A rnan thinks that he is not acting
wrongly, or (α) he confesses to the wrong but thinks it excusable by
the magnitude of the loss he would otherwise incur. To do an injury
to me who perhaps is unimportant and unconnected with himself seems
less serious than death. This is the principle on which most people
act: whereas they ought to be convinced that a disorder of the soul
(and injustice is one) is much worse than any disadvantage affecting the
fortune or the body.
