Introduction xix

To what extent he drew upon his source, and what part of his
work is original, though we cannot follow it out in detail, we
may form a general notion. It is true that he expressly guards
in other passages against the supposition that he merely trans-
lated the original: Sequemur Stoicos, non ut interpretes, sed,
ut solemus, e fontibus eorum iudicio arbitrioque nostro, quantum
quoque modo videbitur, hauriemus 1 2, 6, and Η 17, 60 Panae-
tius, quem multum in lu's libris secutus sum, n on in terp re-
tatus. But, on the other hand, that he did follow Panaetius
closely, especially in the First Book—not only in the general
arrangement of his subject and in its leading ideaS, but also in
most of the detaiIS, as in his choice of examples and ostentimes
even in his expression—this is partly sels-evident‚ partly a just
inference from the method in which the ancients generally, and
Cicero himself in his other writingS, were accustomed to employ
their sources3 though in this treatise‚ which was specially
regulated by and suited to Roman ideaS‚ he shows more inde-
pendence than in his larger philosophical workS.

In the very beginning (ξ 10) of the First Book—which treats
of the honestum (τὸ καλόν), subdivided into the four cardinal
virtues—Cicero finds fault with the incompleteness of Panae-
tius’s division of his subject, and his omission of the question
duobus propositis honestis utrum honestius. Cicero discusses
this subject of a conflict between particular virtues independently
from CH. xliii 152 to the end, in a cursory manner indeed and
not without adapting Poseidonius (CH. xlv 159). But we shall not
be doing him an injustice‚ if we assume that, apart from certain
additions and even omissionS, he has in his First Book really
reproduced the substance of the corresponding part of Panae-
tius's work.

In the Second Book, which treats of the utile, we have only
to glauce at such passages as CH. viii 26 ff„ cHH. xiii and xiv,
CH. xvi f., CHH. xix 65 ff. and xxi, and the last meagre section
CH. xxv, containing the comparatio utilitatum, to be convinced
that we are not reading a mere translation from a Greek philo-
sophica] work. In ξ 86 also two points are lightly touched upon,
which Antipater of Tyre found wanting in Panaetius. On the
