xxii Introduction

have had in his possession a copy of the work of Hekaton—
whom he never mentions elsewhere—much less that he should
have had one at hand in his country house—we may fairly
conclude that he was satisfied with the bellum ὑπόμνημα of
AthenodoruS‚ who contented himself with simply making ex-
tracts from Hekaton, and possibly supplied the notice also of
Antipater of Tyre at the end of the Second Book.

And how has Cicero worked up his material? Obviously in
a cursory and superficial manner. While in the F irst and
Second Books he has not shown indifference to the due arrange-
ment of his subject—its several divisions and subdivisions—
. though with characteristic but unintentional want of precision ;
in the Third Book he abandons all such systematic treatment,
and in the first passage (ξ 96) where mention is made of a
classification, he bungles so completely that some editorS,
jealous of his reputation‚ pronounce it to be spurious. After
the usual introduction concerning his personal position, which
has nothing to do with the contents of the Book, he speaks
(ἐξ 7—1 1) of the relation of Panaetius to the subject. He then
explains how far, according to Stoic principleS, there can be
any question of a conflict between moral rectitude and expediency.
From ξ 19 to ξ 32 he considers the general rule for the 'deter-
mination of such caseS, and gives examples in illustration. After
a pretty full discussion of the subject, he remarks (ξ 33); Eius

modi ngitur credo res Panaetium persecuturum fuisse, nisi aliqui
casus aut occupatio ei'us consilium peremisset, from which we

see that Cicero regarded the preceding discussion as merely
introductory‚ to be followed up afterwards by the actual treatise,
as if the subject had not been already so far exhausted that the
part of it, which was most essential for arriving at a decision‚
had been thoroughly sifted. From ξ 33 onwards there is no
attempt at arrangement or connexion of thought, and we are
not told by the writer until ξ 96 that in this Book, as in the
other tw0‚ the four cardinal virtues have been taken as the basis
of his proof‚ and that he has already dealt with the first two—
prudence and justice. Instances of his defective reasoning may

be seen in ξ 14, ἕ 17, ξ 27, ξ 88 and ἕ 102, and his illustrative
