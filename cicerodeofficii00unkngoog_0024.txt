other hand, when in CH. v 16 and in CH. x 35 Cicero speaks of
his own independent treatment of the subject and criticizes or
appeals to that of Panaetiu5‚ it is a proof indeed, if any were
needed, that he does not stick to his subject-matter slavishly,
but it argues rather in favour of than against his dependence
on his authorities in these passages. Generally, however, the
Second Book gives us the impression of greater independence
of judgment on the writer’s part, even in the arrangement of
the subject.

In the Third Book, the question is broached, how we are to
act in case of a conflict between the honestum and the utile,

i.e. between that which is good in itself and abstractedly, and that
which is good in reference to external objects. Panaetius him-

self had intended to answer this question, but he did not fulfil
his intention (ξ 7).

In this discussion Cicero prides himself on his greater
sels-dependence ξ 34: Hanc partem relictam explebimus nullis
adminiculis, seag ut dicitur, Marte nostro. Neque enim quic-
quam est de bac parte post Panaetium eaplt‘catum, quodquidam
milti probaretur, de eis quae in manus meas venerunt. But it
does not necessarily follow from this statement that he has not
availed himself of any other sources. In fact he expressly
mentions several such by name z—PoseidoniuS, ξ 83 Hekaton of
Rhodes, ξ 63 and ξ 89; Diogenes of Babylon, and Antipater of
Tarsus, ξ 51 to ξ 55 and ξ 91. But we can easily believe, without
any express assurance on his part, that he did not follow any of
these authorities in the same way as he has followed Panaetius
in his First and Second Books. Of Poseidonius indeed Cicero
says that he has touched only briefly on the subject in quibus-
dam commentariis3 from him then Cicero cannot have bor-
rowed much in this Third Book, which contains but little
systematic exposition, and is mostly taken up with examples and
illustrationS.

Again, it would appear that he had never even seen the
writings of Diogenes and Antipater but had learned their views
at second hand, if we may judge from his mode of quotation, by
which he unconsciously reveals to us the fact that he had never
