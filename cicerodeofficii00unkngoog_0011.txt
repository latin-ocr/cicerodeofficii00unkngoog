INTRODUCTION

ξ 1 On tlte date os tlte work and tlte circumstances
in which it was composed

LIKE the principal of the strictly philosophical works of
Cicero¹, the de officiis belongs to the close of his life. 1t was
written in the interval between the death of his beloved and
only daughter Tullia in Feb. B.C. 45 and the end of B.C. 44.

The probable time of its composition is evident from several
allusions in the work itself. The Dictator Julius Caesar has
been murdered (1 ξ 26, 11 ξ 23, 111 ξ 19). The Laelius a'e
amicitia and the two lost books de gloria—neither of which are
to be found amongst his philosophical works enumerated in the
Introduction to the Second Book of the de divinatione which we
know was published after Caesar's death-have already appeared.
Cicero is compelled by his dread of Antonius to keep away from
Rome and remain in the country, with the avowed object os
quitting Italy altogether (ξ 1). But towards the end of the
Third Book he has abandoned this purpose and is e medio cursu
clara voce a patria· revocatus (ξ 121). This, as Cicero himself
explains», alludes to his return journey to Rome on Aug. 31st B.C.
44, after he had actually started for Greece but had been driven
