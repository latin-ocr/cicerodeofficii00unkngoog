1. 14. rura peragrantes] ‘roving from one place in the country to
another.’ In the summer of B.c. 44 Cicero was constantly changing his
place of residence for fear of Antony. He had many country houses, one
at Tusculum (once the property of Sulla), another at Antium (where
he placed his best collection of books), another at Arpinum, two at
Formiae (near the port of Caieta, and upon the mountains adjoining),
another on the shore of Baiae which he calls his Puteolanum, a seventh
on the hills of old Cumae, another at Pompeii. His house at Puteoli was
built after the plan of the Academy at Athens, and called by that name,
ἱ being adorned with a portico and grove sor the purpose of philosophical
conferences. With regard to the means which Cicero had to meet the
expenses, which the possession of so many country seats must have en-
tailed upon him, see the remarks of Middleton in his Life of Cicero ἓ xii.
